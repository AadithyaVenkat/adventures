Repo for adventures.averyethomas.com wordpress theme.

For this I make all updates to style and javascript in the build folder. I used the deploy folder to run test locally of a static version of the site. I used a gulpfile to compile all Pug, SCSS, and Javascript from the build folder into the deployment folder. After all of those tests were run, I converted HTML files into PHP Wordpress template files and updated the gulpfile to compile SCSS & Javascript into the theme folder.
